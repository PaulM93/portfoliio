          Olatoo is built using Next.JS due to its server side rendering
          capabilities which are essential for search engine optimization.
          Firebase was also used due to its ease of use in providing access to
          firebase authentication, the firestore cloud database and the stripe
          subscription extension. As the app was built with Next.JS it felt
          logical to deploy it using Vercel as Next.JS was built by the same
          team.

          The app layout was designed using AdobeXD with photoshop used to edit

          of use, customisation options and vast amount of components.

          A user who signs up to Olatoo is given 3 free trial classes which may
          be booked on signup or through the booking process on the user
          dashboard. If a user books a trial class upon signup they must select
          a tutor country, date and time. Relevant tutors are then filtered
          using firestore web api and once the user has entered their
          authentication details a class is assigned to a tutor at random. The
          user also has the option to choose which tutor they want their classes
          to be with using the booking buttons found on tutor cards.

          Upon account creation user information is saved to firestore and a
          stripe customer account is created which is linked to the relevant
          firestore document. Email verification from the user is required to
          book an Olatoo class but this feature has been turned off due to
          testing. A user books a class using the booking modal found on each
          tutor card. A class type, date and time are chosen and the class is
          then booked and saved to the database under the bookings collection.
          The booking is also added to the relevant tutor document to ensure it
          can be filtered and removed to prevent bookings at the same time.

        <Text fontSize="sm" color="primaryMute">
          Time Zones were also considered with tutors and students coming from
          different parts of the world. This was handled upon signup using
          Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone. The user cannot set
          their timezone but if a timezone change was noted this was
          automatically updated. The relevant timezone was then applied to React
          Calendar using various util functions to show class time slots at the
          correct timezone for the user. MomentJS was also used to handle date
          and time formatting.

          directly from their dashboard. The tutor dashboard also provides

          added to the userâ€™s account and refreshed on a monthly basis. Lesson
          credits are added using metadata.

          Although I am satisfied with what I have been able to achieve in
          building Olatoo, it was my first project and now with more knowledge,
          I may have considered other options to build the app. I am not happy
          with the folder structure and layout of my code but I put this down to
          lack of experience. I had originally built the app with CreateReactApp
          not knowing that this was not good for SEO purposes so I migrated
          everything over to Next.JS which was a difficult process.
